\usage{
get_detections(
  from = NULL,
  to = NULL,
  station_ids = NULL,
  species_ids = NULL,
  species_names = NULL,
  continents = NULL,
  countries = NULL,
  confidence_gte = NULL,
  limit = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{from}{Start datetime as a string in ISO8601 format
(e.g. "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"). Defaults to 24 hours ago if NULL.}

\item{to}{End datetime as a string in ISO8601 format
(e.g. "2025-01-02T00:00:00.000Z"). Defaults to now if NULL.}

\item{station_ids}{Character vector of station IDs to filter on (optional)}

\item{species_ids}{Character vector of species IDs to filter on (optional)}

\item{species_names}{Character vector of species common or scientific names
to filter on (optional). Will be resolved to IDs via find_species().
If a name matches multiple species, the first result is used and all
matches are printed so the user can refine if needed.}

\item{continents}{Character vector of continents to filter on (optional)}

\item{countries}{Character vector of countries to filter on (optional)}

\item{confidence_gte}{Minimum confidence threshold as a float (optional)}

\item{limit}{Maximum total number of detections to return (default: 500).
Set higher for large pulls. Each page fetches 250 at a time.}
}
\value{
A flat data.table where each row is one detection with columns:
id, timestamp, confidence, score,
det_lat, det_lon,
species_id, common_name, scientific_name,
station_id, station_name, station_type, station_timezone,
station_country, station_continent, station_state, station_location,
station_lat, station_lon
}
\description{
Retrieves bird detections from the BirdWeather API with optional filters.
Handles pagination automatically up to the specified limit. Returns a fully
flat data.table with all nested fields (coords, species, station) expanded
into individual columns.
