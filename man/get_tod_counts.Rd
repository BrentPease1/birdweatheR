\title{Get BirdWeather Time of Day Detection Counts}
\usage{
get_tod_counts(
  species_id = NULL,
  from = NULL,
  to = NULL,
  station_ids = NULL,
  confidence_gte = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_id}{A single species ID (required)}

\item{from}{Start datetime in ISO8601 format (e.g. "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z")}

\item{to}{End datetime in ISO8601 format (e.g. "2025-01-02T00:00:00.000Z")}

\item{station_ids}{Character vector of station IDs to filter on (optional)}

\item{confidence_gte}{Minimum confidence threshold as a float (optional)}
}
\value{
A data.table with columns:
species_id, hour, count
where hour is a fractional hour (e.g. 6.5 = 6:30am)
}
\description{
Returns detection counts binned by time of day for a given species.
Each row is one 30-minute time bin. Useful for visualizing daily
activity patterns like dawn chorus or nocturnal behavior.
}
\examples{

# American Robin time of day activity

  species_id = "123",
