  from = NULL,
  to = NULL,
  station_ids = NULL,
  station_types = NULL,
  species_id = NULL,
  ne = NULL,
  sw = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{from}{Start datetime in ISO8601 format (e.g. "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z")}

\item{to}{End datetime in ISO8601 format (e.g. "2025-01-02T00:00:00.000Z")}

\item{station_ids}{Character vector of station IDs to filter on (optional)}

\item{station_types}{Character vector of station types to filter on (optional).
Known types include "puc", "birdnetpi", and "app".}

\item{species_id}{A single species ID to filter on (optional). Use
\code{\link{find_species}} to look up species IDs.}

\item{ne}{Named list with lat and lon defining the north-east corner of a
bounding box (optional). Must be used together with sw.
Example: list(lat = 42.0, lon = -85.0)}

\item{sw}{Named list with lat and lon defining the south-west corner of a
bounding box (optional). Must be used together with ne.
Example: list(lat = 36.0, lon = -96.0)}
}
\value{
A single-row data.table with columns:
detections, species, stations
}
\description{
Returns a single-row summary of detections, species, stations, and BirdNet
detections for a given time period. Useful as a quick platform-wide or
regional snapshot before pulling raw detections.
}
\details{
For finer-grained summaries by species or station over time, see
\code{\link{get_daily_detection_counts}} and \code{\link{get_detections}}.
